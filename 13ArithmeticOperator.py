#EXAMPLES
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)

d = b - a
print(d)

e = a * b
print(e)

f = b / a
print(f)

g = a % b
print(g)

h = b % a
print(h)

i = b // a
print(i)

j = a ** b
print(j)

#This '+' operator is also used in string concatenation
a = "My name is "
b = "Rajnish"
print(a+b)

#We can muliply string too

b = 4
print(a*b)
